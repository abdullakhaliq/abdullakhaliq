ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abdullakhaliq, a newcomer to the world of coding with a keen interest in languages and a love for football. I'm on a journey to master programming and expand my horizons.

ðŸ‘€ Currently, I'm diving into the world of C++ and exploring the German language. Excited to learn, collaborate, and build great things! Let's connect and learn together. ðŸš€
